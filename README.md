This is the Official Repository of "[Rewards Are Enough for Fast Photo-Realistic Text-to-image Generation](https://huggingface.co/papers/2503.13070)", by *Yihong Luo, Tianyang Hu, Weijian Luo, Kenji Kawaguchi, Jing Tang*. 


ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€We introduce **R0**, a novel conditional generation approach via regularized reward maximization. **R0 is the first RLHF algorithm that enables post-training diffusion to few-step text-to-image generator without relying on diffusion distillation or images**.

**Four-step** Samples at 1024 resolution generated by **R0**. The R0 here is trained from SD3-medium **purely by reward maximization**.

Code is coming soon!
