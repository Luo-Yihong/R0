This is the Official Repository of "Rewards Maximization Is Enough for Fast Photo-Realistic Text-to-image Generation", by *Yihong Luo, Tianyang Hu, Weijian Luo, Kenji Kawaguchi, Jing Tang*. 


ðŸš€ Â We introduce **R0**, a novel con ditional generation approach via regularized re ward maximization. **R0 is the first RLHF algorithm that enables post-training diffusion to few-step text-to-image generator without rely on diffusion distillation or images**.

**Four-step** Samples at 1024 resolution generated by **R0**. The R0 here is trained from SD3-medium **purely by reward maximization**.

Code is coming soon!
